## Introduction

The modernization of electrical infrastructure in Chile has been one of the strategic priorities of the last decade, mobilizing investments exceeding US$ 10 billion under the promise of a robust and reliable supply. However, public perception and recent climate events suggest a persistent fragility in the system. This document explores this contradiction, not from the ascesis of traditional technical indicators, but through a sociotechnical lens that integrates hard data with territorial reality.

**Preview of Results**: The analysis of 6.2 million interruption records reveals that while macro-structural investment (Transmission) has reduced restoration times in specific areas such as the "Norte Grande" (REDENOR Case), there is a significant "temporal decoupling": improvements take up to three years to materialize in user-perceived quality. Even more critical, a deep territorial inequality is detected where regions like La Araucanía remain stagnant in chronic failure indicators, evidencing that financial investment alone clashes against unresolved environmental and social barriers.

**Document Structure**: Next, we present the **Background and Theoretical Framework** (Section 1), establishing the lens of Energy Justice and Resilience to interpret the data. The **Methodology** (Section 2) details the processing of raw data and case selection. The central section, **Grid Narratives** (Section 3), exposes empirical results through four paradigmatic case studies. Finally, the **Discussion** (Section 4) and **Conclusion** (Section 5) synthesize public policy implications, questioning whether our current regulatory standards are sufficient for the new climate scenario.

## 1. Background and Theoretical Framework

### 1.1 Theoretical Framework: From Reliability to Energy Justice
To analyze the friction between the modernity promised by investment and the reality lived by the user, this study transcends traditional engineering to adopt contemporary theoretical frameworks linking technique with the social. First, we use the **Infrastructure Resilience Cycle** proposed by Hollnagel (2014), which suggests that in the face of Anthropocene climate volatility, the paradigm must shift from simple "Reliability" —understood as failure minimization— toward **Resilience**. This is defined as the capacity not only to absorb and recover the system after an event but crucially to *Adapt* its functioning to High-Impact Low-Frequency (*HILF Events*) threats. The relevance of this approach is manifest in the adaptation "lag" observed in structural works, suggesting that Chilean engineering has been efficient in resistance but slow in evolutionary adaptation.

Complementarily, the **Energy Justice** framework by Sovacool and Dworkin (2015) is integrated, specifically focusing on the dimensions of Distributive Justice and Justice of Recognition. The theory postulates that technical metrics are not neutral; the regulatory exclusion of "Major Events" from the official quality calculation (SAIFI) constitutes a failure of recognition, where the experience of vulnerability in rural or climate-exposed communities is systematically erased from the administrative record. By ignoring these data in performance evaluation, the regulator constructs a parallel reality that delegitimizes citizen complaints, fracturing the social contract of public service.

### 1.2 International Empirical Background
International literature offers robust precedents validating the tension between capital flows and quality indicators. Investigations by OLADE (2022) in eight Latin American countries have quantitatively demonstrated that an increase in tariff remuneration (VAD) correlates positively with improvements in SAIDI indices, but with a structural temporal lag of between one and two years. This finding provides a critical reference framework for evaluating the Chilean case: detecting maturation times of three years in projects like Cardones-Polpaico indicates institutional and technical friction exceeding the regional average, requiring explanation beyond mere physical construction.

On the other hand, studies on energy poverty in the Caribbean (Garrick et al., 2020) reveal that private investment, while reducing national interruption averages by up to 45%, tends to concentrate its benefits in dense and profitable urban areas. This phenomenon of quality-of-service segregation offers a mirror to interpret Chilean reality, helping to explain why regions with high rurality or territorial conflict, such as La Araucanía, remain stagnant in their reliability levels despite the general investment amounts traded in the market.

### 1.3 National Problem Statement
Chile currently faces a marked "cognitive dissonance" in its electrical sector: the coexistence of historical investment exceeding US$ 10 billion in the last decade with a public perception of extreme fragility, crystallized after the collapse of August 2024. In light of the Resilience and Energy Justice frameworks, this contradiction cannot be explained only by climate severity, but by the rigidity of a regulatory design (IEEE 1366) that, by purging failure statistics, optimizes the grid for regulatory compliance instead of preparing it for survival in the face of the climate crisis.

### 1.4 Purpose and Research Objectives

For this research, the following structural elements have been defined:
*   **Object of Study**: Residential electricity supply quality in relation to transmission infrastructure investment.
*   **Core Concept**: *Sociotechnical Dissonance* (the gap between technological modernization and user vulnerability experience).
*   **Delimitation**: National Electrical System of Chile, period 2017-2025.

**Research Question**:
How does **sociotechnical dissonance** manifest in the relationship between transmission infrastructure investment flows and user-perceived continuity of electricity supply in Chile (2017-2025)?

**General Objective**:
**Explore** how **sociotechnical dissonance** manifests in the relationship between transmission infrastructure investment flows and user-perceived continuity of electricity supply in Chile (2017-2025).

**Specific Objectives**:
1.  **Describe** the quantitative gap between official indicators (regulated SAIFI) and raw interruption data (*Raw Data*), to dimension the operational reality unrecognized by regulations.
2.  **Identify** territorial disconnection patterns in areas of high investment (coverage) but low resilience (continuity), using case studies in the north, center, and south of the country.
3.  **Interpret** this dissonance in light of Energy Justice principles, to propose new categories of analysis that integrate climate and social variables in project evaluation.

## 2. Methodology: Listening to Raw Data

To overcome "statistical hygiene," we adopt a **Multiple Case Study** design with a **Mixed Methods** approach. First, we perform an exploratory quantitative analysis of *Raw SAIFI* —the dirty data, with noise and weather— because that is where the user's truth resides.

> [!TIP]
> **Concept Box: What do we measure when we measure outages?**
>
> *   **Official SAIFI**: Purges "Force Majeure Events" (weather). It's like measuring a patient's fever ignoring the days they had the flu. *Historical average value: ~3.5 - 4.5 interruptions/year.*
> *   **Raw SAIFI (Our Indicator)**: Considers *all* interruptions, without exception.
>     $$ \text{Raw SAIFI} = \frac{\sum \text{Affected Customers (Total)}}{\text{Total Customers (~6.5M)}} $$
>     *Estimated values in our dataset:* 2017 (**~16.2**), 2024 (Peak due to wind). **The gap is almost 4x.**

*Figure 1: Temporal evolution of interruptions and key events (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 1**: The time series reveals peaks that coincide with climate or social events. The initial peak of **"Snowfall July 2017"** stands out, an event that paralyzed Santiago and appears in our raw data with a magnitude similar to subsequent events, although administratively it was "pardoned."

> [!NOTE]
> **Methodological Disclaimer**: Given the exploratory nature of this study, the concept of *Thick Description* (Geertz) is applied here as a tool for interpreting "digital traces" and territorial contexts, and not as a traditional field ethnography with interviews. We seek to "densify" the numerical data by cross-referencing it with local narratives and climate events. (See Annex A).

Secondly, we selected four case studies not for their amount, but for their narrative potential. Each case (Desert, Valley, City, Forest) tells a different story of adaptation or failure.

## 3. Grid Narratives (Results)

### 3.1 The Coquimbo Paradox (The Sleeping Giant)
The Cardones-Polpaico line (500 kV) was celebrated as Chile's energy backbone. However, for three years (2019-2021), the inhabitants of Coquimbo lived a paradox.

![Figure 3: Coquimbo Case](figures/figura3_coquimbo.png)
*Figure 3: Persistence of failures in Coquimbo post-interconnection (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 3**: The graph shows the daily evolution of affected customers (Y-axis) over time (X-axis). The **blue line** represents the number of households without power, and the thicker line smooths this trend (moving average). The **yellow strip** marks the period when the Cardones-Polpaico mega-project entered operation.
Counterintuitively, **the curve does not flatten** after the yellow strip. On the contrary, we observe that failure peaks persist with the same intensity. This empirically demonstrates the three-year *lag*: the "macro-efficiency" of transmission took years to permeate toward the "micro-resilience" of the local distribution network.

### 3.2 Desert Surgery (REDENOR)
In Arica, the case is opposite. Investment in REDENOR acted as an effective surgical intervention.

![Figure 4: Arica Case](figures/figura4_arica.png)
*Figure 4: Impact of redundancy in Arica (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 4**: This bar chart compares total affectation volume year by year. A clear **structural break** is observed: the tall bars of the years preceding the investment collapse to minimum levels after the transmission ring closure (2020). Here, technical redundancy did eliminate vulnerability, validating the thesis that in simple topologies (desert), physical investment has an immediate return.

### 3.3 Southern Fury (Pichirropulli)
In the Los Lagos region, investment hit a green wall. Despite reinforcements in substations such as Pichirropulli, failure indices in forest areas barely improved.

![Figure 5: Company Ranking](figures/figura5_companies.png)
*Figure 5: Companies with highest customer affectation (Source: Own elaboration)*

**The Vegetation Factor**: As seen in the ranking (Figure 5), companies with the highest affectation operate in high forest density areas. Chilean regulations (Technical Standard for Service Quality, CNE, 2020) establish strict safety strips, but territorial reality shows constant friction between power lines and exotic forest plantations. Trees falling on lines remain the main cause of massive failures in the south, suggesting that "the problem is not the cable, it's the tree" (and the territorial planning that allows their coexistence).

### 3.4 The Perception Gap: A Matter of Justice
Finally, looking at the national trend:

![Figure 1: Global Time Series](figures/figura1_timeseries.png)
*Figure 1: Temporal evolution of interruptions and key events (Source: Own elaboration)*

**Interpretation of Figure 1**: The time series reveals peaks that coincide with climate or social events, not with isolated technical failures. The gap between *Official SAIFI* (~4 outages) and *Real SAIFI* visible in these peaks (~12 outages) constitutes a **failure of recognition** (Sovacool, 2015). When the authority purges these "force majeure events," it is statistically erasing the public's vulnerability experience.

## 4. Discussion: Toward an Infrastructure Ecology

The findings force us to rethink the infrastructure-society relationship through the lens of the **Resilience Cycle**. We are not facing a merely technical problem of "putting in more cables." We are facing a crisis of the **Adaptation** phase.

The current strategy has been "robustening" (thicker poles). But in the face of 124 km/h winds in 2024, raw resistance is futile. Should we move toward an "antifragile" network (Taleb), decentralized and capable of failing "gracefully" instead of collapsing catastrophically?

Likewise, the obsession with transmission (High Voltage) has left distribution (Low Voltage) orphaned. Is Chilean society willing to pay the necessary tariff to underground cities, or do we accept vulnerability as the price of cheap energy?

## 5. Open Conclusion

Investment in electrical infrastructure in Chile has been successful in its mission to **integrate markets**, but incomplete in its promise to **guarantee distributive justice**. The detected *lag* is not just time: it is the institutional friction of a country changing faster than its laws.

The question remains open for the reader and the regulator: In an Anthropocene marked by climate volatility, **will we continue designing networks for a climate that no longer exists, based on statistics that erase the events that matter most to us?**

The data tells us *what* happened. The answer about *what to do* is not in Excel, but in the social pact we decide to build.

## Annex A: Methodological Glossary

For the purposes of this exploratory research, the following key concepts are defined:

**1. Case Study**
A research strategy that investigates a contemporary phenomenon within its real context, especially when the boundaries between the phenomenon and the context are not evident. In this study, each region (e.g., Arica Case) is treated as a unique system of interactions between climate, infrastructure, and regulation.

**2. Thick Description**
Concept coined by Clifford Geertz for anthropology, which seeks to explain not only behavior (the data) but its context. In our "digital ethnography," we apply this by cross-referencing *cold data* (a power outage) with *dense context* (a heatwave, a social protest, a territorial conflict) to give meaning to the number.

**3. Mixed Methods**
An approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative data to provide a more complete understanding of the problem. Here, we use descriptive statistics (Time Series, SQL) to find the *what*, and sociotechnical theoretical frameworks (Energy Justice) to explore the *why*.
