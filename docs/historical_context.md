# Historical Context: Chronology of Electrical Stability (2017-2025)

This document cross-references **Data Anomalies** detected in the analysis with **Documented Bibliographic Events** (Press, SEC/CNE Reports).

---

## 2017: The Great Snowfall
**Peak Detected**: July 2017 (~340k affected customers in RM)
- **Event**: Historical snowfall in Santiago (July 15).
- **Figures**: ~337,000 households without power in RM.
- **Cause**: Accumulated snow brought down branches onto power lines.
- **Impact**: Death of one person, review of Enel contracts.
- **Data Validation**: Matches the peak in the chart.

## 2019: Social Unrest (October)
- **Event**: Attacks on infrastructure (Enel Building) and barricades.
- **Electrical Impact**: *Limited*. Massive outages were not the daily norm.
- **Technical Note**: If the chart shows giant peaks in Oct-Nov 2019, check correlation with **Forest Fires** (common at that time) or drought, rather than the unrest itself.

## 2024: The Great August Wind (Historical Record)
**Peak Detected**: August 2024 (>1M simultaneous customers)
- **Event**: Frontal system with hurricane-force winds (124 km/h) on August 2.
- **Official Figures**: 
    - **Peak**: 1,243,904 customers affected simultaneously (National).
    - **Cumulative Total**: 2.4 million households with interruptions in the month.
- **Zones**: RM (Maipú, Las Condes), Araucanía, Biobío.
- **Consequence**: Initiation of the concession expiration process for Enel. Government ultimatums.
- **Data Validation**: The "Infinite Peak" in the chart is **REAL**. It is not a data error.

## Conclusions for the Dashboard
1.  **Validation**: The extreme peaks in the dataset (2017, 2024) are real weather events, not scraping errors.
2.  **Narrative**: Grid fragility in the face of climate change (wind/snow) is the primary driver of instability, weighing more than regular annual investment.

## 4. Infrastructure Milestones (Impact Validation)

| Project | Inauguration | Validated Impact (Data) | Qualitative Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cardones-Polpaico** | Jun 2019 | **3-Year Lag** (Improvement only in 2022) | "National Highway" project (500kV). Did not solve local distribution ("potholes") in Coquimbo until the grid adapted. |
| **Lo Aguirre - C. Navia** | Jul 2019 | **Immediate Improvement** (-14% outages) | Direct reinforcement of the Santiago ring. Relieved critical load in dense areas. |
| **Pichirropulli - Tineo** | 2021 | **Success in Valdivia** (-17%) | Stabilized Los Ríos against storms (e.g., June 2022). No effect in Puerto Montt (Extreme climate). |
| **REDENOR** | 2023 | **Total Success** (-70% outages) | Surgical solution for Arica and Tarapacá. Eliminated endemic desert failures. |
