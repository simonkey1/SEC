# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is elected by the tool or the user instead of being fixed.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or even
#   fail to install, on other platforms.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   poetry.lock
#   pyproject.toml is usually tracked.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
